# INDE577 Course Project Overview - Rice University

This repository hosts my course project for INDE577 at Rice University, under the expert guidance of Professor Randy R. Davila. It delves into several key areas of data science and machine learning, showcasing a range of techniques and methodologies.

## Topics Explored

### Supervised Learning
- Model Building & Error Analysis: Understanding model construction and analyzing errors.
- Linear Regression: Examining relationships through linear models.
- Gradient Descent: An optimization algorithm for finding the minimum of a function.
- Logistic Regression: Classification model for binary outcomes.
- Neural Networks: Exploring the basics of neural network architectures.
- Support Vector Machines (SVM): A robust classification technique.
- k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN): A simple yet effective classification algorithm.
- Decision/Regression Trees: Tree models for both classification and regression.
- Ensemble Learning: Combining multiple models for improved performance.

### Unsupervised Learning
- k-Means Clustering: A method for clustering and segmenting datasets.
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Technique for dimensionality reduction.

## Environment Setup
- Python Version Required: 3.10 or higher.
