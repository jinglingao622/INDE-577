# Decision and Regression Tree Analysis

The repository featuring the `Decision:Regression Tree.ipynb` notebook. This project is dedicated to exploring the concepts, applications, and nuances of Decision Trees and Regression Trees in machine learning.

## Project Overview

Decision Trees are versatile algorithms used for both classification (Decision Trees) and regression (Regression Trees) tasks. They are known for their ease of interpretation and implementation. This notebook dives deep into these algorithms, demonstrating their use-cases, strengths, and limitations.

### Inside the Notebook:

- **Theory and Concepts:** Introduction to the fundamentals of Decision Trees and Regression Trees, including how they split data and make predictions.
- **Practical Implementation:** Step-by-step guide on implementing these tree-based models in Python, using popular libraries.
- **Real-World Applications:** Examples showcasing the application of Decision and Regression Trees on various datasets.
- **Model Evaluation and Tuning:** Techniques for assessing the performance of tree models and strategies for tuning their parameters.

## Environment Setup

- **Python Version:** 3.10
- **Required Libraries:** scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib (for visualization)
