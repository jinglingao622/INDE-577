# K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) Analysis 

This repository houses the `K-Nearest.ipynb` Jupyter notebook, which is dedicated to exploring the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm, a fundamental machine learning technique used for classification and regression.

## Project Overview

The K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm is a simple yet powerful tool in the machine learning toolkit. It makes predictions for new data points based on similarities with nearest neighbors from the training dataset. This project aims to demystify K-NN through practical examples and comprehensive analysis.

### Highlights of the Notebook:

- **Fundamental Concepts:** An introduction to the K-NN algorithm, including its theory and how it works.
- **Implementation Details:** Detailed implementation of K-NN in Python, showcasing both classification and regression applications.
- **Parameter Tuning:** Exploring how different values of 'K' and distance metrics affect the performance of the algorithm.
- **Real-World Datasets:** Application of K-NN on various datasets to illustrate its versatility and effectiveness.
- **Model Evaluation:** Techniques to evaluate and fine-tune the performance of K-NN models.
