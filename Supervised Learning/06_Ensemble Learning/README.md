# Ensemble Learning Techniques

This repository hosts the `Ensemble Learning.ipynb` notebook, a comprehensive guide to the principles and applications of Ensemble Learning in machine learning.

## Project Overview

Ensemble Learning is a powerful approach in machine learning where multiple models, often known as 'weak learners,' are strategically combined to improve the accuracy, robustness, and performance of predictive models. This project delves into various Ensemble Learning methods, providing insights into their workings and benefits.

### Inside the Notebook:

- **Fundamental Concepts:** Introduction to the core principles of Ensemble Learning, including its rationale and advantages.
- **Ensemble Techniques Explored:**
  - **Hard Voting:** In classification, each model votes for a class, and the majority vote decides the final outcome.
  - **Bagging:** Trains models on random subsets of data and averages their predictions.
  - **Random Forests:** A type of bagging with decision trees, combining the output of multiple trees trained on data and feature subse
- **Practical Implementations:** Step-by-step demonstrations of various Ensemble Learning techniques using Python and popular machine learning libraries.
- **Real-World Applications:** Applying Ensemble Learning methods to diverse datasets to solve complex problems.
