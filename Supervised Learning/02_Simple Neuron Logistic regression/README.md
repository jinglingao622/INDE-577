# Logistic Regression

Logistic Regression Project presented in the `Logistic Regression.ipynb` Jupyter notebook. This project is dedicated to exploring the logistic regression algorithm, a fundamental technique in the field of machine learning for classification tasks.

## Project Overview

Logistic Regression is a statistical method for predicting binary outcomes from a set of independent variables. It is an essential algorithm used in various domains, from risk assessment to medical diagnosis and beyond. This notebook aims to provide a comprehensive guide to understanding and implementing logistic regression.
