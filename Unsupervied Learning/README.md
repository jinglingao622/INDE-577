# Unsupervised Learning

This fold where we delve into two of the most pivotal techniques in data science and machine learning: k-Means Clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). This project aims to explore these methods in depth, providing practical implementations and insightful analyses.

## Topics Explored

### k-Means Clustering
- An in-depth exploration of the k-Means Clustering algorithm, a popular unsupervised machine learning technique used for data segmentation. 
- Practical examples demonstrating how k-Means is used to identify clusters within datasets, along with parameter tuning and interpretation of results.

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- A comprehensive study of PCA, a technique used for dimensionality reduction while preserving as much variance as possible.
- Demonstrations on how PCA transforms high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space, making it easier to visualize and analyze.

## Repository Structure

- `kmeans/`: Contains notebooks and scripts demonstrating various implementations and use-cases of k-Means Clustering.
- `pca/`: Includes resources and examples focusing on the application of Principal Component Analysis.

## Environment

- Python Version: 3.10 and above
- Required Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn
