# K-Means Clustering Project

Welcome to the repository for the `K-means.ipynb` notebook, which is dedicated to exploring the K-Means clustering algorithm, a fundamental unsupervised machine learning technique used for data segmentation and pattern recognition.

## Project Overview

K-Means clustering is widely recognized for its simplicity and efficiency in grouping data into distinct clusters. This project delves into the algorithm's theory, practical implementation, and real-world applications, providing a thorough exploration of its capabilities and use cases.

### Inside the Notebook:

- **Algorithm Theory:** An introduction to the principles and mechanics of K-Means clustering, including how it iteratively partitions data into k distinct clusters.
- **Practical Implementation:** Step-by-step guidance on implementing K-Means in Python, using popular data science libraries.
- **Dataset Applications:** Demonstrations of the K-Means algorithm applied to various datasets to highlight its versatility and effectiveness in revealing data patterns.
- **Parameter Tuning:** Exploration of key parameters in K-Means, such as the number of clusters (k), and techniques for optimal parameter selection.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Discussion of methods to evaluate the performance of clustering, including inertia and silhouette scores.

## Environment Setup

- **Python Version:** 3.10
- **Required Libraries:** numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn
